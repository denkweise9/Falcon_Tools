# Falcon_Tools
The Falcon Programming lanuage is a young GNU multi-paradigm language. http://www.falconpl.org/

These tools are very simple and basic, but will grow in complexity as the language grows and as I learn it.
I decided to make a collection of tools when I found out Falcon had things like "getHost()" but not "add(245,200)".
